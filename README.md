# Tutorial
 In this program there are 16 people.
 For every person, they have another person they want to be coupled with.
 As the player, you don't know who this correct person is.
 You find the correct person by selecting sets of two people and then submiting.
 Once you submit you will learn how many of the coupless you selected are correct, but not which couples are.
 After, you choose one couples to send to the "Truth Booth" where you learn if this is a correct couple or an incorrect one.
 Following this, you return to the first step of matching couples again, this time with (hopefully) more information
 If you did not match the couples correctly, you can view your past guesses and try again.
 The game ends when you sucsessfuly match all of the couple correctly.
