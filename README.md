 In this program you try to match couples together.
 This is acomplished by selecting sets of two people and then submiting.
 Once you submit you will learn how many total couples are correct, but not which ones are.
 After, you choose one couples to send to the "Truth Booth" where you learn if this is a correct couple.
 If you did not match the couples correctly, you can view your past guesses and try again.
 The game ends when you sucsessfuly match all of the couple correctly.
